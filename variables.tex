    Technology at the service of a more inclusive society: innovative solutions dedicated to the mobility of ASD people
}

\newcommand{\projectabstract}{
    Nowadays, more and more guiding apps are available, including the evolving transportation methods such as subways and city bikes. Recently, new features came out addressing traveling comfort, which is an essential criteria to accommodate disabled people. But those applications are not sufficient to answer the specific and personal needs of autistic people, mainly crowdedness, noise and light sensitivity. Our goal is to produce an improved guiding app to fill this gap in Toulouse, and more specifically for autistic people in public transportation. To do this, we will use Java and Kotlin, which are the most used languages to develop android apps. We will also use Toulouse public transportation company (Tiss√©o) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) databases to implement this app in the Toulouse environment.

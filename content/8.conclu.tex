\section{Conclusion}

The goal of this project was to develop an routing application that would take into account issues encountered by people with ASD. Thanks to the Tisseo API, we were able to gather information about Toulouse's public transport network. Then, we implemented an A Star algorithm to provide the user with the less troublesome route with additional details on issues the user may encounter and precautions they may take. The application also take into account real-time events to adapt the proposed path. We also provided an adapted interface to make the application easier to use for people with ASD.

However, the application still relies on static data for luminosity and noise, and the extensive use of the Tisseo API restrain the range of use to the city of Toulouse. The next version of the application should focus on gathering information about luminosity and noise from live data. This will improve the adaptability of the routing algorithm and provide better paths to users sensible to those factors. Future works should also implement a routing algorithm inside the application. This will make the application less dependent of the Tisseo API and be a first step to deploy it in other cities. Finally, future version should take into account the feedback of the user to adapt the heuristic of A Star.

This project allowed us to discover the development of mobile app with Kotlin and Android, which is a necessity as most web and desktop application have a mobile version. Additionally, this project also made us consider the accessibility of our application and techniques to ensure everyone can use it. This project was also the opportunity to use Github tools for project handling, which proved to be very useful combined with the agile method.

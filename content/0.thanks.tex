\section*{Thanks}

Throughout this project, we have encoutered a variety of challenges. Thanks to the involvement of our supervisor, Nawal Guermouche, we were able to overcome most of them. She helped us during many steps of our project, and guided us through the usage of kotlin, when we were completely new to it. She allowed us to keep the big picture in mind through her regular informed feedback and helped us plan the different versions of our application.

Moreover, this application would not be what it is if not for the collaboration of Tiss√©o, which has been pivotal in the success of this project. Most of our appplication would simply not function without the access they granted us to their Application Programming Interface (API)\cite{tisseo}.

We sincerely thank them for their commitment to us, for their trust and their unwavering support throughout the project.

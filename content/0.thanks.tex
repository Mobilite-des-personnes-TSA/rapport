\section*{Thanks}

We have encoutered different problems while developing the application. Thanks to the involvment of our teacher, Nawal Guermouche, we succeeded to overcome all these challenges. She helped us in many steps of our project. For example, she guided us through the usage of kotlin, when we were completely new to it. She also helped us planning the different versions of our application.


In addition, Tiss√©o (the public transportation company in Toulouse) helped us since the second version of our project. For instance, they let us use their Application Programming Interface (API)\cite{tisseo}, to access their database.


We express our sincere thanks to them.

\section{Thanks}

We have encouter differents problem when develloping the application. We have succes to all this challenges, because we have canned count on our teatcher Nawal Guermouche. She help us in many step of our project. Like in the first place when we was completly new to Kotlin, or when we were planning the different version of our application.


In addition, since the second version of our project, we have been hep by Tiss√©o (the company of public transport in Toulouse). In particular, they let us use their Application Programming Interface (API)\cite{tisseo}, to acces at their database.


We address them a special thanks.
